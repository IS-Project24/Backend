# IS Project Backend

Welcome to the IS Project Backend repository! This repository serves as the backend component for the IS (Intelligent Systems) Project, focusing on EV (Electric Vehicle) monitoring and fault detection, as well as user management functionalities.

## Objective

The primary objective of the IS Project Backend is to provide a robust and scalable backend system to support the monitoring and management of Electric Vehicles. The key objectives include:

- **EV Monitoring**: Implementing mechanisms to monitor the status, performance, and health of electric vehicles in real-time.
- **Fault Detection**: Detecting and analyzing faults or anomalies in electric vehicles to ensure optimal performance and safety.

- **User Management**: Providing user authentication, authorization, and management functionalities for system administrators, vehicle owners, and other stakeholders.

## Features

- **Real-time EV Monitoring**: The backend system enables real-time monitoring of electric vehicles, capturing key metrics and parameters such as battery level, temperature, and performance indicators.

- **Fault Detection Algorithms**: Advanced fault detection algorithms are implemented to analyze data streams from electric vehicles and identify potential issues or anomalies that may require attention.

- **User Authentication and Authorization**: Robust user authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place to ensure secure access to system functionalities based on user roles and permissions.

- **Data Persistence and Storage**: The backend system utilizes a reliable database system to persist and manage data related to electric vehicles, user accounts, fault logs, and system configurations.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the IS Project Backend locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/is-project-backend.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using your preferred package manager (e.g., pip):

   ```
   cd is-project-backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Database Configuration**: Configure the database connection settings in the configuration files (e.g., `config.py`) as per your environment requirements.

4. **Run the Application**: Start the backend server by running the main application file (e.g., `app.py` or `run.py`):

   ```
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the Backend**: Once the server is running, you can access the backend API endpoints using your preferred API testing tool (e.g., Postman) or integrate the backend with frontend applications.
